                I'm a detail-oriented, structured, and adaptable professional with a proven ability to manage complex workloads and parallel deadlines. My career has been built on versatility and reliability, excelling in both independent and collaborative environments—including acting in leadership roles. I'm driven by continuous learning, innovative problem-solving, and the value of diverse perspectives. Beyond work, I'm a proud husband and father of two, and I'm passionate about staying active and enjoying quality time with my family.

                <h3>The Adrenaline Years</h3>
                <p>
                  Growing up in a picturesque lake town, I was drawn to extreme sports and movement—skateboarding, gymnastics, and freerunning defined my childhood. These activities instilled in me a love for pushing boundaries, continuous improvement, and the thrill of mastering complex skills. I spent my first 20 years in that tight-knit community, where water sports and outdoor activities were part of daily life.

                <h3>Physics & the Cosmos</h3>
                <p>
                  At age 20, I moved to Lund University to pursue my passion for understanding the universe. What began as a Bachelor of Science in Physics evolved into a Master's degree in Astrophysics. Through rigorous research and hands-on scientific work, I discovered that the same precision and dedication I brought to skateboarding could be channeled into unraveling the mysteries of stars, galaxies, and stellar dynamics.

                <h3>International Research</h3>
                <p>
                  After completing my Master's degree, I was selected for one of just 13 doctoral projects at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, chosen from over 500 applicants. For nearly two years, I immersed myself in cutting-edge research on star-planet interactions using 3D MHD simulations, contributing to published work that advanced the field. This experience gave me international exposure, refined my ability to communicate complex ideas across disciplines, and strengthened my independent research capabilities.

                <h3>Engineering & Verification</h3>
                <p>
                  Returning to Sweden, I transitioned into the professional world as a Test and Verification Engineer, first at Saab Dynamics and now as a Consultant. This chapter has been about applying my analytical mindset to solving real-world engineering challenges—designing rigorous test strategies, managing complex requirements, and leading teams through critical system validations. The shift from theoretical astrophysics to practical system engineering has been gratifying, combining precision with tangible impact.

                <p>
                  Today, I'm happily married with two wonderful children—a son and a daughter—who keep life interesting and grounded. My priorities have evolved to balance career ambitions with family time. In my spare moments, you'll find me skateboarding again (some habits never fade!), exploring music production, diving into coding projects, and taking care of our home. These varied interests reflect my belief that a fulfilling life comes from embracing curiosity across multiple domains.
