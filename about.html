              <p class="intro-text">
                I'm an engineer and astrophysicist who enjoys solving complex problems and building things that work reliably. I have a background in both academic research and industrial system verification—two very different worlds that have taught me different things. I work well independently and in teams, and I've had the chance to lead others, which I genuinely enjoy. Beyond work, I'm married with two kids and I'm committed to being present for them while continuing to pursue my interests in technology and problem-solving.

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            
            <div class="journey-timeline">
              <!-- Phase 1: Early Years -->
              <div class="journey-phase">
                <div class="phase-icon">🛹</div>
                <h3>The Adrenaline Years</h3>
                <p>
                  I grew up in Motala, a small lakeside town in Sweden where I spent a lot of time skateboarding, doing gymnastics, and generally moving around. Those years taught me the value of practice, persistence, and not being afraid to fail in front of an audience. I left home at 20 to study physics, but that same mindset—push yourself, get back up, improve—has stayed with me.
                </p>
              </div>

              <!-- Phase 2: Academic Path -->
              <div class="journey-phase">
                <div class="phase-icon">🔭</div>
                <h3>Physics & the Cosmos</h3>
                <p>
                  I studied physics and then astrophysics at Lund University, spending years learning how stars and planets interact. I genuinely enjoyed the research—there's something satisfying about understanding how systems work at a fundamental level. Physics taught me to think carefully, question assumptions, and accept when your calculations show something unexpected.

                <h3>International Research</h3>
                <p>
                  I spent two years doing a PhD at Leiden Observatory on star-planet interactions, which was a significant opportunity. The work was technically challenging and required independence—you have to figure out your own approach when no one has solved exactly your problem before. I published work from that period and learned how to present technical ideas clearly, which has proven invaluable.

                <div class="phase-icon">🛠️</div>
                <h3>Engineering & Verification</h3>
                <p>
                  After the PhD, I moved into system verification and testing. I've worked at Saab Dynamics and now consult for other organizations. It's different from academic research—the problems are often more constrained but the stakes are clearer. You're verifying that a system works as intended, which requires rigor but also pragmatism. I've led small teams, managed requirements, and worked on systems that matter to actual users.

                <h3>Family & Balance</h3>
                <p>
                  I'm married with two kids, which has definitely changed my perspective on what matters. My career is important to me, but not as important as being present for my family. I still skateboard when I can, mess around with music production, and spend time on various coding side projects. I'm someone who likes to understand how things work, whether that's a system, a piece of software, or just how to make something I'm interested in.

                <h3>Learning by Doing</h3>

                <h3>Good Engineering</h3>

                <h3>Balance</h3>
                <p>A good career is part of a good life, not the whole thing. I take my work seriously and try to be good at what I do, but not at the expense of everything else.</p>
