      "summary": "After my Master’s degree, I was selected for one of 13 projects at Leiden Observatory from over 500 applicants, where I worked on star–planet interaction modeling using 3D MHD simulations and data analysis. The project resulted in a publication and required structured, independent work with complex systems. I improved existing simulation tools in Fortran, developed analysis and processing workflows in Python, and handled large scale datasets with version control in Git. I regularly communicated results to technical and cross disciplinary audiences at national and international events. The work strengthened my ability to deliver high quality technical output, ranging from method development and verification to clear documentation—and led to a nomination to a Caltech Think Tank on future space mission concepts",
