AB Dor is a young solar-type  star with a surface  large-scale  magnetic  ﬁeld 10 2 to 10 3 times stronger  than the that of the Sun. 
Although  strong magnetic  ﬁelds are thought  to inhibit  coronal  mass ejections  (CMEs),  dimming  signatures  typically  associated  
with an eruptive  CME were recently  observed  in AB Dor. The uninterrupted,  long-duration  dimming  signal suggests  that a 
CME took place at a high latitude,  where it remained  in view as the star rotates.  A high-latitude  CME is also consistent  with 
observations  that indicate  that AB Dor hosts polar active regions.  To investigate  magnetic  conﬁnement  in AB Dor, we conduct  
a parametric  modelling  study of 21 CMEs  at latitudes  ∼60 ◦, varying  the location,  mass, and magnetic  ﬁeld strength  of an 
injected  ﬂux rope. 12 models  had the ﬂux rope located  in an open magnetic  ﬁeld region,  while the remaining  nine were in a 
closed  region.  Results  show that CMEs  in open-ﬁeld  regions  are in general  more likely to erupt. The four eruptive  CMEs  from 
closed  regions  had high free magnetic  energies  /greaterorsimilar 3 ×10 35 erg, and 10 CMEs  predominantly  from the closed-ﬁeld  regions  (8/10) 
were conﬁned.  CMEs  in closed-ﬁeld  regions  exhibited  lower kinetic  energies,  since part of the CME energy  was expended  to 
o v ercome  magnetic  tension  and break open the o v erlying  ﬁeld. In conclusion  our work suggests  that eruptive  CMEs  in AB Dor 
may occur in high-latitude  regions  of open magnetic  ﬁeld, as the magnetic  tension  in such regions  does not signiﬁcantly  inhibit  
the eruption.

1 INTRODUCTION  
Even though the Sun is a relatively  magnetically  inactive  star, it 
hosts a plethora  of burst and transient  events, in which free magnetic  
energy is violently  released  and converted  into radiation  and the 
acceleration  of particles.  The sudden  burst of radiation  in the form 
of ﬂares can be associated  with the expelling  of material  from the 
Sun in the form of ﬁlament/prominence  eruptions  and coronal  mass 
ejections  (CMEs).  The ﬂare–CME  association  is in particular  more 
evident  for large solar ﬂares (e.g. Yashiro  et al. 2006 ). Given the 
magnetic  nature of these e xplosiv  e ev ents, and the fact that solar- 
like stars can be substantially  more magnetically  active than the Sun 
(particularly  at young ages; e.g. Donati et al. 1999 ; Waite et al. 2015 ; 
Cang et al. 2020 ), solar-like  stars are expected  to not only host bursty 
e vents, but e ven more frequent  and energetic  ones (Aarnio,  Matt & 
Stassun  2012 ; Drake et al. 2013 ; Osten & Wolk 2015 ; Jardine  & 
Collier Cameron  2019 ; Odert et al. 2020 ). This idea is supported  by 
the detection  of stellar ﬂares and superﬂares  (e.g. G ¨udel et al. 2004 ; 
Maehara  et al. 2012 ; Ha wle y et al. 2014 ; Kowalski  2024 ). 
In spite of the numerous  detections  of stellar ﬂares observed  
across the electromagnetic  spectrum,  unambiguous  detection  of 
a counterpart  CME remains  challenging  (Moschou  et al. 2019 ; 
Namekata  et al. 2022 ). The indirect  evidence  of the presence  of 
stellar CMEs is based on a range of detection  methods,  including  
Doppler  shifts in Balmer  lines (Vida et al. 2019 ), X-ray blueshifted  
⋆ E-mail: e vensberget@strw.leidenuni  v.nl emission  (Argirofﬁ et  al. 2019 ; Chen et al. 2022 ), and, more recently,  
coronal  dimming  observed  in the X-ray, extreme  ultraviolet  (EUV),  
and far -ultra violet (Leitzinger  et al. 2020 ; Veronig  et al. 2021 ). 1 
Eruptions  have also recently  been reported  in the young, rapidly  
rotating  star EK Draconis  (Namekata  et al. 2021 , 2024 ) and in 
/epsilon1Eridani  (Loyd et al. 2022 ). In the Sun, coronal  dimming  is usually  
observ ed after eruptiv  e ev ents (Harra et al. 2016 ; Mason et al. 2016 ), 
with more than 80 per cent of solar CME e vents sho wing succeeding  
dimming  signatures  (Veronig  et al. 2021 ). As the CME propagates,  
e v acuated  mass behind the CME shock front does not contribute  (or 
contribute  less) to X-ray and EUV coronal  emission  (Mason  et al. 
2016 ), generating  a dimming  in X-ray/EUV  light curves.  
Moti v ated by the solar analogy,  it has been suggested  that stellar 
CMEs could also produce  dimming  signatures.  Recently,  Veronig  
et al. ( 2021 ) examined  stellar spectra  in EUV and X-ray from 
observ ational archi ves for about 200 stars. These authors  detected  
13 different  stars that showed  dimming  associated  with ﬂares –t h i s 
association  is indicative  of stellar CMEs.  In particular,  these authors  
found ﬁve dimming  events on AB Dor (HD 36705),  a rapidly  rotating  
young solar-mass  star, with an age of about 120 Myr, a rotation  period 
of 0.51 d, and kG (kilo-Gauss)  surface  magnetic  ﬁelds (Donati  et al. 
1999 ; Hussain  et al. 2007 ; Strassmeier  2009 ; Barenfeld  et al. 2013 ). 
1 Although  Type II radio bursts, usually associated  with solar CMEs, are 
promising  ways to detect stellar CMEs (Crosley  et al. 2016 ), no stellar Type 
II radio bursts have been reported  yet.

High-latitude  CMEs  in AB Dor 1157 
MNRAS  533, 1156–1165  (2024) The coronal  dimming  event from 1994 recorded  by EUVE ( Ex- 
treme Ultraviolet  Explorer  ) showed  a surprisingly  long dimming  
lasting 13.3 h from ﬂare peak to the end of the dimming  (Veronig  
et al. 2021 ). Because  the duration  of the event is comparable  to the 
∼0 . 5 d rotation  period of AB Dor, Veronig  et al. ( 2021 ) suggested  
that the associated  CME might have originated  in a region that is 
constantly  in view of the observer,  namely  at high latitudes.  This is 
in line with observations  that show that AB Dor’s rotation  axis has an 
inclination  of 60 ◦(Donati  et al. 1999 ). Interestingly,  AB Dor exhibits  
polar active regions  (Collier  Cameron  & Unruh 1994 ). Using again 
the Sun as analogy,  given that the majority  of solar CMEs tend to 
originate  in activ e re gions, it is very plausible  that the CME event 
reported  by Veronig  et al. ( 2021 ) could have also originate  from 
polar activ e re gions. In the Sun, both low- and high-latitude  CMEs 
are observed  and their source regions  differ. While the more abundant  
low-latitude  CMEs originate  from solar activ e re gions (concentrated  
in a belt of ±40 ◦around the equator),  high-latitude  CMEs originate  
from polar crown ﬁlaments  (e.g. Gopalswamy,  Yashiro  & Akiyama  
2015 ; Lin et al. 2022 ). Understandably,  the spatial information  we 
ha ve a vailable  for AB Dor is substantially  inferior  to that of the 
Sun. Here, we speculate  that the source of the high-latitude  CMEs in 
AB Dor is its polar active regions.  
One potential  problem  for the eruption  of CMEs in AB Dor, or 
any other magnetically  active star, is that the star itself hosts a strong 
( ∼kG), large-scale  surface  magnetic  ﬁeld, which can prevent  the 
eruption  of CMEs.  The numerical  study of Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 
( 2018 ) showed  that a stronger  o v erlying  large-scale  dipolar  magnetic  
ﬁeld can prevent  CMEs from escaping  unless their energies  are much 
stronger  than energies  typically  associated  with solar CMEs.  To better 
understand  the eruption  (or conﬁnement)  of CMEs in the young, 
active star AB Dor, in this work, we conduct  a parametric  study 
of CME eruptions  using three-dimensional  magnetohydrodynamical  
models.  The combination  of a dimming  time that is longer than the 
rotation  period of AB Dor (Veronig  et al. 2021 ) and the presence  
of polar active regions  (Collier  Cameron  & Unruh 1994 ) led us 
to explore  the ejection  of high-latitude  CMEs only. Our paper is 
structured  as follows.  Section  2 introduces  the numerical  model 
we use in this work, including  the data-driven  background  wind of 
AB Dor and the eruption  model of the CMEs.  In Section  3 , we present  
the physical  properties  of the simulated  CMEs of our numerical  study, 
their morphology  and their eruptive  (or conﬁned)  nature, and their 
energetics.  Section  4 shows our discussion  and conclusions  of this 
work. 
2 MODELS  
2.1 The background  stellar wind model 
To model the wind of AB Dor, we use the Alfv ´en Wave Solar Model 
( AWSOM  ; Sokolov  et al. 2013 ; van der Holst et al. 2014 ), which is 
implemented  in the 3D magnetohydrodynamics  (MHD)  code BATS - 
R-US (Powell  et al. 1999 ; T ´oth et al. 2012 ). This model solves the 
MHD equations,  assuming  that Alfv ´en waves heat and accelerate  the 
stellar wind. Although  initially  developed  to describe  the solar wind, 
this model has been used also to model winds of cool dwarf stars 
(e.g. Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 2018 ; Evensberget  et al. 2021 , 2022 , 
2023 ; Kavanagh  et al. 2021 ; ´O Fionnag  ´ain et al. 2021 ; Vidotto  et al. 
2023 ). We refer the reader to these papers for more details of the 
model. 
In addition  to the mass (0 . 86 M ⊙), radius (0 . 96 R ⊙), and rotation  
period (0.514 d) of AB Dor, the main input of our model is the 
radial surface  magnetic  ﬁeld of AB Dor. Here, we use the 2002 
Figure 1. Surface magnetic  ﬁeld structure  of AB Dor, derived from spec- 
tropolarimetric  observations  performed  in 2002 December  (Hussain  et al. 
2007 ). Two rectangular  patches display the two different  ﬂux rope locations  
for the simulated  CME models:  the green patch is located at the open magnetic  
ﬁeld region, while the magenta  patch is at the closed-ﬁeld  region. The white 
circle and cross indicate  the maximum  and minimum  magnetic  ﬁeld strengths.  
The average strength  of the depicted  radial ﬁeld is 105 G. 
December  surface  magnetic  ﬁeld map, obtained  from a series of 
spectropolarimetric  observations,  from Hussain  et al. ( 2007 ). This 
map is reconstructed  using Zeeman–Doppler  imaging  (ZDI; Semel 
1989 ; Donati & Landstreet  2009 ). The map we adopt in our work 
is described  by spherical  harmonics  up to degree /lscript max = 25 and is 
shown in Fig. 1 . We see that the radial surface  ﬁeld strengths  range 
from −573 to 466 G. 
The inner boundary  of our simulation  is placed in the chromo-  
sphere,  where we adopt similar values as those used in the simulations  
of the solar wind by e.g. Evensberget  et al. ( 2023 ). We assume  
a density  of 2 ×10 −11 cm −3 and temperature  of 5 ×10 4 K. The 
wave dissipation  length scale at the boundary  is assumed  to be 
1 . 5 ×10 5 m √ 
T , and the Poynting  ﬂux-to-ﬁeld  ratio at the inner 
boundary  is set to 10 6 W m −2 T −1 . Finally,  the heat conduction  
contains  a stochastic  heating  term of 0.18, a heat ﬂux parameter  
of 1.05, and a collisionless  radius of 5 R ⋆ . We refer the reader to 
van der Holst et al. ( 2014 ) for a detailed  description  of these model 
parameters.  
Our numerical  grid is spherical  with the smallest  grid size of 
1 / 256 R ⋆ close to the stellar surface  (radial distances  ≤1 . 7 R ⋆ ) and 
around the current  sheet. We also have a conical  region with the 
same resolution  extending  throughout  the domain,  having its base at 
the region where the CME is initiated  and propagates.  Elsewhere  in 
the grid, the resolution  is kept at 1 / 64 R ⋆ . The grid extends  out to 
24 R ⋆ . 
Prior to the injection  of the CME ﬂux rope, we let the simulation  
evolve until the stellar wind reaches  a steady-state  conﬁguration,  
as shown in Fig. 2 . At this point, we compute  the wind mass-loss  
rate as the mass ﬂux through  a spherical  surface  at a certain distance  
abo v e the stellar surface  ˙M = /contintegraltext 
ρu r d A . We found a mass-loss  rate of 
10 −12 M ⊙yr −1 ∼53 ˙M ⊙, which lies within estimates  of Cohen et al. 
( 2010 ) and below the upper limit derived  from prominence  studies 
by Jardine  & Collier Cameron  ( 2019 ). We see that the magnetic  ﬁeld 
embedded  in the stellar wind resembles  an inclined  dipole, and we 
ﬁnd wind speeds reaching  a maximum  value of ∼1000 km s −1 at 
large distances  in the polar regions.  
The steady-state  wind solution  of AB Dor serves as the background  
wind for the 21 CME events we simulate.  
2.2 The eruption  model of the CME 
To initiate the CMEs in our models,  we add a magnetic  ﬂux 
rope whose footpoints  are anchored  at the inner boundary  of our 
simulations.  Similar  CME eruption  models  have been adopted  in Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/533/1/1156/7729277 by guest on 12 February 2026

by the radial magnetic  ﬁeld ZDI map. The domain of the ﬁgure extends out 
to roughly 8 R ⋆ , and the axis of rotation is in the vertical direction.

indicate  the polarity of the radial magnetic  ﬁeld with values −900 G (blue) 
to + 900 G (red). The underlying  line current present during the formation  of

inside the ﬂux rope in the ﬁgure. 
numerical  studies of solar (e.g. Jin et al. 2013 , 2017a ) and stellar 
(Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 2018 ; ´O Fionnag  ´ain et al. 2022 ) CMEs.  
Here, we use the ﬂux rope model based on Titov & D ´emoulin  
( 1999 ), in which virtual magnetic  charges  and currents  along the 
toroidal  symmetry  axis produce  a toroidal  ﬂux rope with a spiralling  
magnetic  ﬁeld in its interior  (see Fig. 3 ). The injection  of the ﬂux 
rope perturbs  the background  wind solution  and in many cases this 
leads to an eruptive  CME event. 
To elucidate  which ﬂux rope parameters  should be adopted  in 
the simulations  of stellar CMEs,  our parametric  study comprises  21 
CME simulations  with different  ﬂux rope characteristics.  The ﬂux 
rope model by Titov & D ´emoulin  ( 1999 ) can be described  by eight 
parameters.  The ﬁrst three parameters  describe  the geometrical  shape of the ﬂux rope and are held constant  in all our models:  the major 
radius of the ﬂux rope toroid R maj = 128 Mm, the minor radius 
R min = 20 Mm, and the depth below the inner boundary  of the toroid 
symmetry  axis D = 1 Mm. This loop structure  mimics  a strong 
magnetic  bipole anchored  at the surface  of the star. In the context  
of solar CME models,  the ﬂux rope position  and size are adjusted  
to match the solar activ e re gions from which CMEs are observed  to 
originate  (e.g. Manchester  et al. 2008 ; Jin et al. 2017b ). In the case of 
stars, these geometric  considerations  are not well constrained  (Lynch  
et al. 2023 ); we cannot observationally  resolve  the size and distances  
of magnetic  bipolar  regions  in stellar surfaces.  Therefore,  the values 
used here are the same as those used in CME simulations  of /epsilon1Eridani  
performed  by ´O Fionnag  ´ain et al. ( 2022 ) and on the same ballpark  as 
to values used in solar (e.g. Roussev  et al. 2003 ; Loesch  et al. 2011 ; 
Jin et al. 2013 ) and stellar (e.g. Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 2020 ) CME 
simulations.  
The next two parameters  determine  the energy of the resulting  
CME and are varied in our simulations:  the ﬂux rope mass and 
magnetic  ﬁeld. In our work, M FR ranges from 3 . 5 ×10 14 to 3 . 5 ×
10 18 G. The lower end of these values is comparable  to the ﬂux 
rope mass of Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. ( 2020 ). Given these assumed  
masses  and the volume  of the ﬂux rope ( ∼5 ×10 29 cm 3 , according  
to the assumed  geometry),  the average  density  inside the ﬂux rope 
ranges from ∼10 9 to ∼10 13 cm −3 . For comparison,  the densities  
in X-ray coronal  plasma  can ranges from ∼10 8 to ∼10 13 cm −3 , 
depending  on the activity  of the star (G ¨udel 2004 ). For the ﬂux rope 
magnetic  ﬁeld strength  B FR , we use values from 100 to 1000 G. 
Stellar ﬂare observations  estimate  the magnetic  ﬁeld in the ﬂare 
region to range from 30 to 400 G (Namekata  et al. 2017 ), and Lynch 
et al. ( 2019 ) argue that starspot/stellar  active regions  could have ﬁeld 
strengths  of 250–1400  G. The values we chose for B FR span the 
values found in these two studies.  Another  avenue that gives support  
to a stronger-than-solar  small-scale  ﬁeld for AB Dor comes from 
observations  of the total unsigned  ﬁeld of active stars. Typically,  
it is found that the large-scale  ﬁeld derived  in spectropolarimetric  
observations  (such as that presented  in Fig. 1 ) encompasses  only a 
fraction  ( ∼10 per cent ) of the total surface  ﬁeld (i.e. including  the 
small- and the large-scale  ﬁelds; see e.g. Vidotto  et al. 2014 ). Given 
that the large-scale  ﬁeld alone of AB Dor is already  a couple of orders 
of magnitude  larger than solar, we speculate  that this increase  would 
be also found in the smaller  scale ﬁeld structure.  Of course,  there is 
still a de generac  y between  the ﬁlling factor of active regions  and their 
typical ﬁeld strengths  –f o r example,  we do not know whether  a higher 
unsigned  total ﬁeld would result in large active regions  with weaker  
ﬁeld strengths  or in smaller  activ e re gions with stronger  magnetic  
ﬁelds. 
The value of B FR is used to set a current  I FR = 2 cR maj B FR / 4 π( c 
being the speed of light) that ﬂows along the arc of the ﬂux rope so that 
the magnetic  ﬁeld strength  at the ﬂux rope symmetry  axis is B FR . In 
the literature,  the ﬂux rope parameter  that is more commonly  referred  
to is the free magnetic  energy instead  of the B FR . The free magnetic  
energy is computed  as (see Titov & D ´emoulin  1999 ; Roussev  et al. 
2003 )

is the arch angle of the emerging  ﬂux 
rope and L is its inductance.  Since we only vary B FR and M FR , we 
have that L = 2 . 39 ×10 −10 s 2 cm −1 in all our models.  Likewise,  the 
parenthesized  term in the expression  for L is a geometrical  factor 
with value 2.69. We note that E B

High-latitude  CMEs  in AB Dor 1159 
MNRAS  533, 1156–1165  (2024) ﬂux rope, the free magnetic  energy in the ﬂux rope ranges from 
4 . 5 ×10 33 to 4 . 5 ×10 35 erg. These values match the range adopted  
in previous  stellar CME studies (Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 2018 , 2020 ; 
´O Fionnag  ´ain et al. 2022 ), with the lower bound values found in 
solar CME simulations  (Manchester  et al. 2008 ; Jin et al. 2013 ). The 
higher end of our values are on the ballpark  of energies  observed  
in stellar superﬂares  ( /greaterorsimilar 10 34 erg; e.g. Shibata  et al. 2013 ; Maehara  
et al. 2015 ). Finally,  we also compute  the poloidal  ﬂux φFR 
p of the 
ﬂux rope, by integrating  the unsigned  magnetic  ﬁeld passing  through  
a perpendicular  cross-section  at the apex of the ﬂux rope. The ﬁrst 
column  of Table 1 shows the parameters  of the ﬂux rope for each of 
the 21 CME simulations.  Each combination  of M FR , B FR , and ﬂux 
rope location  leads to a different  CME evolution.  
Three ﬁnal parameters  determine  the location  and orientation  of 
the emerging  ﬂux rope on the stellar surface.  In this study, we either 
place the ﬂux rope in the region of open magnetic  ﬁeld lines (a green 
patch in Fig. 1 ) at a longitude  of −76 ◦, a latitude  of 55 ◦, and an 
orientation  of −30 ◦with respect  to east–west  line, or at a region of 
closed magnetic  ﬁeld (magenta  patch in Fig. 1 ) at a longitude  of 0 ◦, 
latitude  of 65 ◦, and an east–west  orientation.  Note that we initialize  
our ﬂux ropes at these high latitudes,  because  AB Dor shows signs 
of polar active regions  and a recent indication  that it hosts CMEs 
at polar regions  (see Section  1 ). The two positions  were chosen to 
place the ﬂux rope in the open and closed magnetic  ﬁeld regions  of 
the star, respectively.  
Table 1 shows the initial parameters  of the ﬂux ropes alongside  
resulting  CME characteristics  (presented  in Section  3 ). To distinguish  
between  our various  models,  each model has a unique identiﬁer  
symbol.  The numbers  inside each symbol  show the ﬂux rope mass 
in grams (g) and the ﬂux rope ﬁeld strength  in Gauss (G). The 
colour also indicates  the magnetic  ﬁeld strength  of the ﬂux rope 
according  to the colour bar shown in Table 1 . The shape of the symbol  
indicates  whether  the ﬂux rope is initiated  in a closed (square)  or open 
(rounded)  magnetic  ﬁeld re gion. F or instance,  the symbol  
means that the ﬂux rope has a mass of 3 . 5 ×10 18 g , a magnetic  ﬁeld 
of 1000 G, and is located  at a region where the stellar magnetic  ﬁeld 
is closed (square).  In the same way, the symbol  represents  a 
ﬂux rope with mass 3 . 5 ×10 16 g , a magnetic  ﬁeld of 200 G, located  
in an open-ﬁeld  region (rounded).  
3 PHYSICAL  PROPERTIES  OF OUR 
SIMULATED  CMES  
3.1 Ov er view of our simulated  CMEs 
We injected  21 different  ﬂux rope conﬁgurations  into our background  
stellar wind model and let the eruption  evolve.  Fig. 4 shows the 3D 
images  of 15 simulated  CMEs at a snapshot  of 1 h evolution.  The 
isosurface,  used to track the CME e volution,  sho ws where the ratio 
between  the wind particle  density  n at a given simulation  time and 
the steady-state  stellar wind n ss is n/n ss = 4. The isosurface  colour 
represents  the relative  speed of the CME compared  to the background  
wind, u rel = u r −u r, ss , and the inner boundary  is coloured  by the 
surface  magnetic  ﬁeld strength.  Six models  are not shown in Fig. 4 , 
as no o v erdense  re gion remains  after 1 h. 
Several  factors seem to inﬂuence  the resulting  CME morphology.  
Because  the energy released  from the erupting  ﬂux rope must 
o v ercome  the o v erlying  magnetic  tension  and open the ﬁeld lines to 
escape,  the location  of the ﬂux rope with respect  to the background  
stellar wind magnetic  ﬁeld changes  the amount  of magnetic  energy 
needed  for a CME to escape (e.g. Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 2018 ). The magnetic  tension  of the stellar magnetic  ﬁeld is larger in regions  of 
closed ﬁeld lines, and hence a higher ﬂux rope energy is required  
to break up the o v erlying  ﬁeld compared  to ﬂux ropes injected  in 
open-ﬁeld  regions.  This can be seen for example  in model 
in Fig. 4 , where we ﬁnd the most extended  CME at 1 h of evolution.  
This case has the most energetic  ﬂux rope conﬁguration  (largest  mass 
and largest magnetic  ﬁeld) and is located  in the region of open ﬁeld 
lines. Model shows a ﬂux rope with identical  parameters  but 
is now located  in the closed-ﬁeld  line region. While this CME is also 
sufﬁciently  energetic  to break up the magnetic  tension,  it propagates  
at a slower speed and, hence, does not reach the same distance  as 
the case in the open-ﬁeld  line region . It should be noted that 
it is not only the initial o v erlying  ﬁeld strength  that inﬂuences  the 
propagation  of the CME but also the rate at which the o v erlying  ﬁeld 
is decaying  with stellar height (Deng & Welsch  2017 ). 
Fig. 4 also shows cases with nearly no CME evolution  like model 
, where the ﬂux rope energy is not sufﬁcient  to o v ercome  the 
o v erlying  magnetic  tension.  This model has a weaker  ﬂux rope ﬁeld 
strength  of 300 G. This event is classiﬁed  as conﬁned  and has an 
average  speed of −29 km s −1 (i.e. material  falling back to the star) 
after 1 h of evolution  (more about CME conﬁnement  is discussed  in 
Section  3.2 ). Next to this model, we have the event , generated  
with the same ﬂux rope conﬁguration  but located  in the open-ﬁeld  
region. Despite  their similar ﬂux rope characteristics,  this CME has 
a mean average  speed of 716 km s −1 . The energy in this case is 
sufﬁcient  for the CME to break through  the o v erlying  ﬁeld. CME 
escapes  and acquires  a mass of around 9 . 2 ×10 17 g, while 
the counterpart  model has a mass of about 1 . 5 ×10 17 g, 
but remained  conﬁned.  We continue  the discussion  about the mass, 
velocity,  and energetics  of the CMEs in Section  3.3 . 
As the CME propagates  through  the stellar wind, it changes  the 
local properties  of the wind. Our model , for example,  reaches  
a radial velocity  at its apex of ∼1700 km s −1 . The local plasma  
temperature  during the acceleration  process  of the CME can reach 
up to tens of millions  of K (Kelvin)  close to the shock created  in front 
of the expanding  CMEs apex, while temperatures  behind the CME 
(typically  in regions  where plasma  is e v acuated)  can be a few orders 
of magnitude  colder. During  this time, eruptive  and energetic  CMEs 
are extremely  overdense  and can, in some regions,  yield plasma  
density  ratios of a few thousand  times that of the local stellar wind. 
CME is another  notable  case, which fragmented  o v er time 
and generated  one main and two smaller  CME regions  (similar  effects 
have been shown in e.g. Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 2022 ). The local wind 
in front of the CME is heated and accelerated  to velocities  that are 
about a factor of 3 of the background  wind. This CME creates a region 
with speeds exceeding  the local Alfv ´en speed and produces  a shock. 
Compared  to the main CME fragment,  the smaller  child fragments  
in model form regions  of slower wind speeds behind them, 
with speeds down to about half of the background  (original)  wind 
speed. The smaller  fragmented  pieces are not fast enough  to generate  
a shock and are still attached  to closed magnetic  ﬁeld lines. 
3.2 Conﬁned  versus eruptive  CMEs

in column 1; the quantities  inside the symbol are the ﬂux rope mass and the magnetic  ﬁeld in the centre of the ﬂux rope B FR . A rounded  (square)  shape indicates  
that the ﬂux rope is initiated  in the open (closed)  magnetic  ﬁeld region of the star. The outline colour also gives a visual indication  of B FR . The poloidal  ﬂux of 
the ﬂux rope is φFR

of the CME E k

SXR and 
E ﬂcomputed  directly from φFR 
p as described  and discussed  in Section 3.3 . 
the CME has a positive  average  velocity  at this time. The left 
(right) panel shows the events that were initiated  in the region 
where the stellar magnetic  ﬁeld has closed (open) conﬁgurations.  
The events marked  in orange are the ones that erupted,  while the non- 
erupti ve e vents are sho wn in blue. In total, we have 10/21 conﬁned  
events. 
Overall,  our 10 conﬁned  events tend to be located  in regions  of 
closed ﬁeld lines (their symbols  are squares),  indicating  that the input 
ﬂux rope energy is too weak to break the o v erlying  ﬁeld tension.  
The only two conﬁned  events located  in open ﬁeld lines, 
and , have a weak ﬂux rope magnetic  ﬁeld B FR = 100 G . In 
other words, for a CME to erupt, its initial ﬂux rope requires  a higher 
magnetic  ﬁeld if it is located  in a region of closed ﬁeld lines compared  
to events taking place in open-ﬁeld  line regions.  In our simulations,  
no models  with initial ﬂux rope magnetic  ﬁelds B FR /lessorsimilar 800 G were 
eruptive  for closed-ﬁeld  CMEs.  For open-ﬁeld  CME models,  the 
threshold  was B FR /lessorsimilar 200 G (horizontal  lines Fig. 5 ). 
Additionally,  some eruptive  CMEs leave behind a dense region of 
plasma.  This can be seen in models  and , where we see a blob of plasma  loitering  at the inner boundary.  In this case, a 
fragment  of the erupting  CMEs mass is falling back to the stellar 
surface  because  it is unable to o v ercome  the gravitational  potential  
of the star. The plasma  trapped  close to the stellar surface  is three 
orders of magnitudes  denser than the main front of the CME in these 
models.  We classify  these events as eruptive  because  the bulk of the 
CME mass has escaped.  
3.3 CME energetics  
To compute  the energetics  of the simulated  CMEs,  we use their radial 
speeds and masses.  The velocities  we present  in this work are the 
maximum  speed of the material  enclosed  in the volume  of the CME, 
which is deﬁned  by a density  ratio n/n ss ≥4 ( ´O Fionnag  ´ain et al. 
2022 ). The masses  in our models  are calculated  by integrating  the 
density  within this volume.  Note that other studies apply different  
values for the ratio when determining  the CME region (e.g. Alvarado-  
G ´omez et al. 2020 use a factor of 3 instead).  By decreasing  this ratio, a 
larger CME volume  is produced,  thus a higher mass. (We calculated  
the CME masses  using either a density  ratio of 4 or 3, but found 
results within the same order of magnitude.)  The kinetic energy of Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/533/1/1156/7729277 by guest on 12 February 2026

and Table 1 is shown in the leftmost  axis. Note that E free

FR . each CME is then calculated  from the CME mass and velocity.  Fig. 6 
shows the maximum  speeds,  masses,  and kinetic energies  of each 
CME as a function  of the poloidal  magnetic  ﬂux of the ﬂux rope φFR 
p . 
We calculate  this by integrating  the unsigned  magnetic  ﬁeld passing  
through  a perpendicular  cross-section  at the apex of the ﬂux rope. 
It is interesting  to note that the poloidal  magnetic  ﬂux of the ﬂux 
rope has been used as a proxy for X-ray ﬂare energy in stellar CMEs 
studies (Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 2018 ). 
We see in Fig. 6 (a) that, after 1 h of evolution,  the maximum  speeds 
of the eruptive  events range from 220 to 3700 km s −1 , while the lowest 
velocity  points refer to conﬁned  events. Note that in this ﬁgure, we 
do not include  the six conﬁned  events that did not propagate  outward  
after 1 h ( , , , , , and ). The 
maximum  CME speed we found is around ﬁve times higher than 
the average  background  wind velocity  ( u r, ss /similarequal 720 km s −1 ) at the 
1 h mark. For the eruptive  models,  CMEs occurring  in the closed 
regions  (square  symbols)  have lower radial velocities  than the ones 
occurring  in open-ﬁeld  regions  (circle symbols),  for the same ﬂux 
rope conditions  (e.g. models  and ). This is due to 
the stronger  magnetic  tension  e x erted on the CME material  by the 
o v erlying  closed magnetic  ﬁeld lines. 
For comparison,  we also plot in Fig. 6 (a) the relations  derived  
from solar wind studies from Tschernitz  et al. ( 2018 , dashed–dotted  
line) and Salas-Matamoros  & Klein ( 2015 , dotted line), which were 
rewritten  as functions  of φFR

MNRAS  533, 1156–1165  (2024) Figure 6. Maximum  speed (a), mass (b), and kinetic energies  (c) of the 
simulated  CMEs after 1 h of evolution  as a function  of poloidal  magnetic  
ﬂux of the ﬂux rope. Symbols  are as presented  in Table 1 . In panel (a), we 
show the two relations  derived from solar CMEs as dotted and dash–dotted  
lines. In panel (b), we ﬁt power laws to the cases with ﬂux rope masses 
M FR = 3 . 5 ×10 18 g. In panel (c), the dashed line stands for the energy 
threshold  E k = 2 E ﬂ, which is a good proxy separating  conﬁned  or eruptive  
events. ( 2018 ). CMEs in open regions  agree better with the solar relation  
from Tschernitz  et al. ( 2018 ), while closed-region  CMEs show lower 
speeds than the solar trends. Solar CME speeds range from a few 
hundred  up to a few thousand  km s −1 (Yashiro  et al. 2005 ). 
From Fig. 6 (b), we ﬁnd that both the mass and poloidal  ﬂux 
of the ﬂux rope go v ern the mass of the ejected  CME, agreeing  
with the ﬁndings  of Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. ( 2018 ). For ﬂux ropes 
of similar masses,  we ﬁnd that increasing  the poloidal  ﬂux (and 
therefore  the hypothetically  assumed  ﬂare energy)  in general  leads 
to larger CME masses  after 1 h of evolution.  This is in agreement  
with observations  of solar and stellar CMEs (e.g. Aarnio et al. 2011 ; 
Drake et al. 2013 ; Takahashi,  Mizuno  & Shibata  2016 ; Moschou  
et al. 2019 ), where CME mass and speed are found to increase  with 
increasing  X-ray ﬂare energy,  typically  used as a proxy for poloidal  
ﬂux (Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 2018 ). Fig. 6 (b) shows two power-law  
ﬁts to the cases with ﬂux rope masses  of M FR = 3 . 5 ×10 18 g, where 
we found that M CME [ g ] = 10 −4 . 001 ( φFR 
p [ Mx ]) 1 . 003 and M CME [ g ] = 
10 −10 . 85 ( φFR 
p [ Mx ]) 1 . 276 for the open (dash–dotted  line) and closed 
(dashed  line) ﬁeld models,  respectively.  There is a faster increase  in 
the CME mass with poloidal  ﬂux for the events located  in closed-ﬁeld  
line re gions, ev en though their CME masses  are smaller  than the ones 
placed in open-ﬁeld  line regions  (see below).  As we discuss  further 
in Section  4 , we caution  the reader that in our parametric  study, we 
do not vary the geometry  of the ﬂux rope, which would also affect 
the amount  of free energy available  for driving  the CME. Therefore,  
the relations  shown in Fig. 6 are limited  to this assumption  of our 
model. 
Although  there is an increase  of CME mass with poloidal  ﬂux, 
we also see that for the same poloidal  ﬂux and varying  range of ﬂux 
rope masses,  our models  predict a range of CME masses.  In general,  
the most massive  ﬂux ropes tend to generate  CMEs that are more 
massive.  Models  with ﬂux rope masses  of 3 . 5 ×10 18 g evolve into 
CMEs with masses  ranging  from 1 . 3 ×10 17 to 4 . 1 ×10 18 g after 1 h 
of evolution.  (For reference,  the 1859 Carrington  solar CME event 
had an estimated  mass of 8 ×10 16 g; Cliver & Dietrich  2013 .) We 
found that CMEs with initially  smaller  ﬂux rope masses  typically  
collect material  while propagating  through  the stellar wind. This 
results in an increase  in the evolved  CME mass by up to two orders of 
magnitude  (see models  and , which have CME masses  
abo v e the initial ﬂux rope masses).  Conversely,  CMEs with initially  
higher ﬂux rope masses  are prone to losing mass, either since parts of 
the CME are conﬁned  and fall back onto the stellar surface,  or because  
the CME becomes  more attenuated  as it propagates  outwards  (the 
mass is then decreased  since less of the plasma  satisfy the condition  
that n/n ss ≥4). The two models  deviating  from this behaviour  are 
and , where the evolved  CME mass is larger than the 
initial ﬂux rope mass. 
Models  with similar initial values of M FR and B FR , but initiated  in 
different  (open/closed)  re gions, e xhibit different  CME masses  after 
the y hav e evolv ed. In open regions,  a larger fraction  of the initial ﬂux 
rope mass of the CME becomes  energetic  enough  to escape,  which 
results in higher CME masses  (compare  e.g. with , or 
with ). This is also seen in the ﬁts provided  in panel 
(b), where the ﬁt for the open-ﬁeld  line lies abo v e the closed-ﬁeld  
one.

with positiv e v elocities  at 1 h. We also show the eruptive/conﬁned

if E k < 2 E ﬂ, and eruptive  otherwise  (Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 2018 ). Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/533/1/1156/7729277 by guest on 12 February 2026

High-latitude  CMEs  in AB Dor 1163 
MNRAS  533, 1156–1165  (2024) The four lowest points in Fig. 6 (c) correspond  to conﬁned  events, 
while the other points correspond  to eruptive  events. Therefore,  our 
models  agree well with the energy threshold  (dashed  line). Some 
conﬁned  CMEs (in particular  and ) have energies  even 
below 10 29 erg. The kinetic energies  of eruptive  CMEs range from 
about 10 31 to 10 35 erg. 
Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. ( 2018 ) presented  a way to connect  the 
poloidal  ﬂux, derived  from simulation  parameters,  to the observed  
Geostationary  Operational  Environmental  Satellites  ( GOES ) peak 
soft X-ray ﬂuxes of solar ﬂares. Following  this approach,  we use the 
relations  between  ﬂare energy ( E ﬂ), soft X-ray ﬂuxes ( F ﬂ
SXR ), and 
poloidal  ﬂuxes ( φFR 
p ), namely  
E ﬂ= 10 34 . 49 [ F ﬂ
SXR ] 0 . 79 
and 
φFR 
p = 10 24 . 21 [ F ﬂ
SXR ] 0 . 580 
(Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 2018 ; Tschernitz  et al. 2018 ), to compute  
the ﬂare energy as 
E ﬂ= 10 1 . 5143 [ φFR 
p ] 1 . 3621 . 
Here the units of φFR 
p , F ﬂ
SXR , and E ﬂare Mx, W m −2 , and erg, respec-  
tively. With these relations,  the φFR 
p in our CME models  correspond  
to ﬂare ﬂuxes F ﬂ
SXR ranging  from 2 . 0 ×10 −5 to 1 . 4 ×10 −3 W m −2 
and ﬂare energies  E ﬂfrom 6 . 0 ×10 30 to 1 . 7 ×10 32 erg (see Table 1 ). 
The most energetic  CME, model , corresponds  to a ﬂare ﬂux 
of F ﬂ
SXR ≈1 . 4 ×10 −3 W m −2 , which would have been classiﬁed  
as a GOES class X10 CME. This CME acquires  a velocity  of 
∼3800 km s −1 with a total mass of ∼4 . 1 ×10 18 g and a kinetic 
energy of 2 . 9 ×10 35 erg at 1 h of evolution.  For reference,  most 
solar CMEs have observed  masses  in ranges of 10 14 –10 16 g with 
velocities  reaching  up to around 1000 km s −1 and kinetic energies  in 
the interval  10 28 –10 30 erg (Gopalswamy  et al. 2010 ; Webb & Howard  
2012 ). Note that a small part of the CME mass in this model reached  
the edge of the model domain  at 1 h of evolution  and that its energies  
therefore  can be slightly  underestimated.  
Finally,  the resulting  CMEs depend  on whether  the ﬂux rope is 
injected  in regions  of open or closed ﬁeld lines. Model is 
initiated  with the same ﬂux rope properties  as , but in a 
closed-ﬁeld  region. The overlying  ﬁeld is able to reduce the CME 
energy to only ∼4 per cent of the energy of the equi v alent model 
initiated  in the open region. We can also compare  the two similar 
models  and . These models  also have the same initial 
ﬂux rope set-up, differing  only in terms of the o v erlying  magnetic  
ﬁeld. The closed-ﬁeld  model has its energy reduced  by about six 
orders of magnitude  and remains  conﬁned.  In the cases of models  
and , both models  have enough  input energy to escape 
the o v erlying  ﬁeld and still hav e sufﬁcient  energy left after 1 h of 
evolution.  These results demonstrate  that not only the energetics  of 
the ﬂux rope but also the property  of the stellar wind background  
ﬁeld are key properties  in shaping  the energetics  and the evolution  
of the CME. 
4 DISCUSSION  AND CONCLUSION  
It has been expected  that active stars, which ﬂare more frequently  
than the Sun, would have more frequent  ejections  of CMEs (Aarnio  
et al. 2012 ; Drake et al. 2013 ; Osten & Wolk 2015 ). Yet, it has been very challenging  to detect stellar CMEs (Namekata  et al. 2022 ). 
Because  of this, it has been suggested  that CMEs in active stars 
might be more frequently  conﬁned  (Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 2018 ; 
Sun, T ¨or ¨ok & DeRosa  2022 ). One reason for this is that the strong 
o v erlying  surface  magnetic  ﬁelds observed  in these stars would not 
allow the material  to break open the o v erlying  magnetic  tension,  
thus conﬁning  the eruption  of a CME. Ho we ver, recently,  Veronig  
et al. ( 2021 ) reported  the detection  of coronal  dimmings,  which are 
indicative  of the presence  of eruptive  CMEs.  One of these stars, the 
young and active solar-type  star AB Dor, presented  a high-latitude  
CME (Veronig  et al. 2021 ). 
In this work, we investigate  this by conducting  a parametric  
study with 21 simulations  of CME events on AB Dor. AB Dor 
sho ws polar acti vity in the form of polar spots, so all our modelled  
CMEs were injected  in high-latitude  ( λ∼60 ◦) regions.  First, we 
modelled  the steady-state  wind of AB Dor, using a reconstructed  
magnetic  map based on spectropolarimetric  observations  made in 
2002 December  (Hussain  et al. 2007 ). Secondly,  ﬂux ropes with 
different  properties  were initiated  and allowed  to evolve through  the 
steady background  wind. We used the model of Titov & D ´emoulin  
( 1999 ) to describe  the ﬂux rope. In our parametric  study, we only 
assumed  one particular  geometry  for the ﬂux ropes, but the central 
magnetic  ﬁeld strength  of the ﬂux rope, the mass of the ﬂux rope, 
and also the region where the ﬂux rope was placed varied in each 
run. The ﬂux rope was either placed in a region with an o v erlying  
closed magnetic  ﬁeld or in a region with an overlying  open magnetic  
ﬁeld. We then performed  a series of analyses  to the CME events that 
were generated.  Our ﬁndings  can be summarized  as follows.  
About half of our modelled  events resulted  in eruptive  CMEs,  with 
the other half leading  to conﬁned  CMEs.  CMEs initiated  in open 
regions  were more likely to be eruptive  compared  to those initiated  
in closed regions.  In our simulations,  no models  with initial ﬂux rope 
magnetic  ﬁelds under ∼800 G were eruptive  for closed-ﬁeld  CMEs.  
For open-ﬁeld  CME models,  the limit was around 200 G (Fig. 5 ). 
The initial parameters  and the position  of the ﬂux rope go v ern the 
evolved  morphology  and energetics  of the CME. Models  with larger 
input poloidal  ﬂuxes (i.e. ﬂux ropes with higher magnetic  ﬁelds) 
produce,  in general,  CMEs with higher velocities,  higher masses,  
and thus higher kinetic energies.  We also ﬁnd that the initial mass of 
the ﬂux rope go v erns the ﬁnal mass and therefore  kinetic energies  of 
the produced  CMEs,  with ﬂux ropes that are more massive  tending  
to generate  more massive  CMEs (but note also the large spread seen 
in Fig. 6 ). 
Closed-region  CMEs require  more initial energy in their input ﬂux 
ropes to break open the o v erlying  magnetic  ﬁeld line and o v ercome  
the magnetic  tension.  Therefore,  the energetics  of the CME after 1 h 
of evolution  is strongly  dependent  on the o v erlying  ﬁeld geometry,  
where eruptive  CMEs produced  in an open-ﬁeld  region are generally  
faster and more massive  (i.e. higher kinetic energies)  compared  to 
eruptive  CMEs produced  in the closed-ﬁeld  region. Our eruptive  
closed-ﬁeld  line CMEs attain lower velocities  compared  to what we 
ordinarily  observe  for solar CMEs after 1 h of evolution.  Conversely,  
the majority  of eruptive  open-ﬁeld  line CMEs are faster than solar 
CMEs after 1 h of evolution.  
We also computed  observable  quantities,  such as ﬂare energy and 
ﬂare ﬂuxes, from model parameters  (poloidal  magnetic  ﬂux of the 
ﬂux rope), following  the approach  used in Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 
( 2018 ). In our models,  for a given poloidal  ﬂux with different  ﬂux 
rope masses,  we have only one ﬂare ﬂux (or one ﬂare energy)  
estimate,  but multiple  CME properties.  This implies  that we cannot 
uniquely  characterize  the energetics  of CMEs only from observa-  
tionally  derived  ﬂare quantities.  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/533/1/1156/7729277 by guest on 12 February 2026

MNRAS  533, 1156–1165  (2024) The free magnetic  energy in our ﬂux rope depends  on both the 
size and the magnetic  ﬁeld of the ﬂux rope ( E B 
free ∝ R 3 
maj B 2 
FR , see 
equation  1 ). Given that in our parametric  study, we only used one 
particular  geometry  for the ﬂux rope, all the variation  assumed  in the 
free magnetic  energy only comes from the variation  on B FR . This is 
a limitation  of our parametric  study, as the length scales of ﬂaring 
loops can vary by several orders of magnitude  (Shibata  & Yok o yama 
1999 , 2002 ; Namekata  et al. 2017 ). In the future, it would interesting  
to expand  our parametric  study to also include  different  sizes of ﬂux 
ropes. F or e xample,  there are combinations  of rope geometries  and 
ﬁeld strengths  that would generate  the same free magnetic  energy 
and it would be interesting  to investigate  how this combination  of 
parameters  would affect the CME energetics.  
Our work explains  how eruptive  CMEs such as those observed  
by Veronig  et al. ( 2021 ) may occur even in stars such as AB Dor 
whose strong o v erlying  magnetic  ﬁelds should lead to more conﬁned  
CMEs (Alvarado-G  ´omez et al. 2018 ). We propose  that, in stars with 
polar active regions,  where the overlying  magnetic  ﬁeld lines can 
become  open, CMEs can more easily escape the stellar surface  and 
propagate  into the stellar wind. It is also interesting  to note that in our 
models,  the most energetic  CMEs expand  considerably,  including  in 
the direction  towards  the equatorial  plane, where potential  planets  
would be orbiting.  Therefore,  even though the CME originates  
in stellar polar re gions, the y would still affect the space weather  
environment  around planets  orbiting  in the equatorial  plane. As 
the observational  epochs of the dimming  event and the surface  
magnetic  map observations  are not contemporaneous  (1994 and 
2002, respectively),  it is possible  that the stellar surface  magnetic  
ﬁeld has evolved  between  the two epochs.  Therefore,  simultaneous  
observations  probing  potential  CMEs and the stellar magnetic  ﬁeld, 
such as those of Namekata  et al. ( 2024 ), are of great value.
